 TUPLE - It's similar like list. In lists it can be changed by some operations
      like .append, .insert etc. But once a tuple is made, it can't be changed.


 eg :

marks = (95, 98, 96 , 98, 98, 98)
print(marks.count(98)) # Tuples can count no. of times an element exists.

print(marks.index(98)) # Vo wla index no. print hoga jo sbse phle present h.

Zaroori nhi h tuple me () ho, even without that ,by default it is a tuple.
 eg :
person = "ram", "shyam", "vijay", "ram"
print(person) # on printing tuple milega in the parenthesis()


 SETS - stores unique values.
        It doesn't have the index number, hence are also known as unordered.
        Denoted as curly brackets. {}

eg :#marks ={90, 99, 98, 97, 93}

for score in marks :
    print(score)

 DICTIONARY : It stores the information of key and value(i.e, in pairs)

eg :'''


marks = {"Pragya" : 21, "Neha": 21}
print(marks)
